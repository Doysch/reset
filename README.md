Reset was a bootcamp project built in a team of 4 based around an idea which aims to boost mental health. 

Have you ever been stressed at work? Modern life gets very hectic and there comes a point where something needs to change. There is a lot of research on how taking time out from a stressful environment into a green space which can help reduce the impact of persistent stress and improve productivity. We have coupled this with the act of mindfulness - a form of meditation where you become more aware of your senses and feelings -  into our app, Reset. 

Reset is a mobile app that finds the green space for you to get away from that stressful environment. It provides you with:
<ul>
  <li> options of different greenspaces local to you with photos, reviews and star ratings </li>
  <li> the time it will take to walk at a mindful pace in minutes to your greenspace</li>
  <li> either a calming musical accompaniment or guided meditation to your walk based on your choice </li>
  <li> registers and saves your stress levels before an after the walk </li>
  <li> provides a personal dashboard where you can see your previous walks </li>
  <li> provides the ability for you to record your own experiences in a diary </li>
  <li> reviews of the greenspaces from other users</li>
</ul>

We built it from scratch to production using Ruby on Rails with JavaScript, SCSS, Stimulus and utlising Mapbox APIs and Chartkick.js. 

We had 8 days to design and implement this. We used Figma to design the look and wireframe, and trello to maximise productivity and assignment of tasks.

If we were to do this again we would have spent more time making the front end look slicker and more user-friendly. However, we decided to make it a priority to make it functional considering the core idea of our app being mental health focussed.
