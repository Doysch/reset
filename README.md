Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Reset was a bootcamp project built in a team of 4 based around an idea which aims to boost mental health. 

Have you ever been stressed at work? Modern life gets very hectic and there comes a point where something needs to change. There is a lot of research on how taking time out from a stressful environment into a green space which can help reduce the impact of persistent stress. We have coupled this with the act of mindfulness - a form of meditation where you become more aware of your senses and feelings into our app Reset. 

Reset is a mobile app that finds the green space for you to get away from that stressful environment. It provides you with:
<ul>
  <li> options of different greenspaces local to you with photos </li>
  <li> the time it will take to walk there at a mindful pace in minutes</li>
  <li> either a calming musical accompaniment or guided meditation to your walk based on your choice </li>
  <li> registers and saves your stress levels before an after the walk </li>
  <li> provides a personal dashboard where you can see your previous walks </li>
  <li> provides the ability for you to record your own experiences in a diary </li>
  <li> reviews of the greenspaces from other users</li>
</ul>


We built it from scratch using Ruby on Rails with JavaScript, SCSS, Stimulus and utlising Mapbox APIs. 


We had 5 days to design and implement this. We used Figma to design look and wireframe. We used trello to keep track of what was being done and we were all able to work on front and back end design. 

We ran out of time during the challenge, so could not complete the application as we would have liked. We prioritised making it functional rather than how it looked.
